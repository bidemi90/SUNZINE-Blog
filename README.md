NEW BLOG APP 
Blog Web App
This is a web application that allows users to create, edit, and delete blog posts. The application uses HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, and local storage to store data.

Features
Create blog posts: Users can create new blog posts by entering a title and content in the provided fields. Once a post is created, it is added to the list of existing posts.
Edit blog posts: Users can edit existing blog posts by clicking on the "Edit" button next to a post. The title and content of the post can be updated in the provided fields, and the changes are saved automatically.
Delete blog posts: Users can delete existing blog posts by clicking on the "Delete" button next to a post. Once a post is deleted, it is removed from the list of existing posts.
Local storage: All blog posts are stored locally in the browser's local storage. This means that the posts are saved even if the user closes the browser or refreshes the page.
Responsive design: The application is built using Bootstrap, which ensures that it looks great on all screen sizes, including mobile devices.
Getting started
To use the application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The application will load automatically, and users can start creating, editing, and deleting blog posts.

Dependencies
The application does not have any external dependencies. All required libraries (Bootstrap and jQuery) are included in the assets folder.

Future improvements
Add support for multiple users: Currently, the application only supports a single user. In the future, it would be great to add support for multiple users, each with their own set of blog posts.
Add search functionality: As the number of blog posts grows, it may become difficult for users to find the posts they are looking for. Adding a search feature would make it easier for users to find specific posts.
Add comments: Allowing users to leave comments on blog posts would be a great way to increase engagement and foster a sense of community.
